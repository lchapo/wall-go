# Wall‑Go 🧱♟️

![cover](public/cover.png)

> Wall Go (牆壁圍棋) – Free, open-source online strategy board game inspired by Devil’s Plan 2. Supports 2–4 players, solo (AI) or with friends, territory scoring, undo/redo, and a modern UI. [Wall Go, Devil's Plan, React, TypeScript, GitHub, board game, browser game]

## About this fork

This is a fork of [schaoss/wall-go](https://github.com/schaoss/wall-go) that layers a few
extra quality-of-life features on top of the original — a running score counter that tracks
results across a series of matches, named players instead of just colours, more control over
how far back you can rewind a game, and more besides. The rules and core gameplay are
unchanged; everything here is additive, so a game plays exactly as it does upstream.

## Features

- 7×7 board, move and wall mechanics faithfully implemented
- 2–4 player support: solo (AI), two-player, three-player, or four-player
- Multi-language UI: English, 繁體中文, 简体中文, 日本語, 한국어, Español
- Modern, responsive UI (Tailwind CSS v4), mobile-friendly
- Robust undo/redo (Zustand snapshot time travel)
- All static text fully internationalized (i18next)
- SEO meta tags and social sharing optimized (react-helmet-async)
- All core logic covered by unit tests (Vitest)
- Static build, deployable to GitHub Pages or any static host

## Game Overview

- Supports 2–4 players (AI or human)
- **Placing phase**: players alternate placing stones (fixed start for 2P, special order for 3/4P)
- **Playing phase**: select a stone, move up to 2 steps (orthogonal only), then build a wall
- **Walls**: unlimited, color-coded; 2P walls cannot be removed, 3/4P each player has one wall-break per game
- **Time limit**: 90 seconds per turn (auto-wall if timeout)
- **End**: when all stones are in separate territories
- **Scoring**: each territory cell = 1pt; if tied, largest single territory wins; if still tied, draw
- Undo/redo at any time
- Rules dialog and accessibility labels fully localized
- AI difficulty and side selection
